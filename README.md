# Memory-Allocation
Based on the lectures from Real-time Operating Systems, this code aims to improve my coding skills in C#. 
The purpose of this is to implement my own version of malloc(3), free(3) and related functions.

 - Understand the challenges and trade-offs inherent in memory allocation
 - practice interacting with the OS kernel via system calls and
 - practice implementing data structures in C.
